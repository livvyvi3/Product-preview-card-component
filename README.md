## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge has helped me with practicing my skills on responsive web development.And try to give back exactly what the client has designed. Making use of CSS custom properties which also assited with consistency on my theme colors, font-family and sizes, saved me time from repitition keeping the consistency smooth.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
**root CSS custom properties**
.proud-of-this-css {
  :root {
    --prmry-clr: hsl(125, 25%, 47%);
    --sec-clr: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
    --ff-prmry: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
    --ff-sec: "Fraunces", sans-serif;
    --fs-1: 2rem;

}
}
```


### Continued development

I feel I need more practicing more of these designs, until I can be really good with delivering the exact designs in code, with little or no assitance.
